    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups mushroom broth</li>
        <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 ounces mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat the mushroom broth over medium heat until warm. Keep it on low heat while preparing the risotto.</li>
        <li>In a separate large saucepan, melt the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until they become translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced mushrooms to the saucepan and cook until they are tender and browned. Remove a few mushroom slices for garnishing later, if desired.</li>
        <li>Add the Arborio rice to the saucepan and stir well to coat the grains with the butter and oil mixture. Cook for a minute to lightly toast the rice.</li>
        <li>Pour in the white wine and stir until it is absorbed by the rice.</li>
        <li>Ladle in a small amount of warm mushroom broth (about 1/2 cup) to the rice mixture. Stir constantly until the broth is absorbed. Repeat this process, adding more broth gradually as it is absorbed, until the rice is al dente (tender with a slight bite) and creamy in texture. This will take about 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Cover the saucepan and let the risotto rest for a couple of minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Serve the mushroom risotto in bowls, garnished with the reserved mushroom slices and an additional sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
