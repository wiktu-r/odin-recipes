        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is softened.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine, and simmer the sauce for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese over the top of the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.</li>
